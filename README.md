## About the project

App wrote in React which allows to use the [pomodoro learning technique](https://cnc.bc.ca/services/prince-george/testing-tutoring/student-support-advice/pomodoro-technique). When it comes to "React" aspect such a project is something new for me. So far most of my React project have used extarnal API to gets some data and do something with them.
